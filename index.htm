			<p class="chapterone">

				The world began with fossils, though they were not fossils at the time. Now we study them as remnants of
				a distant history, but once they were living breathing organisms. Now incapsulated in rock, how much
				truth can we distil from stone?

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Stone has served humans as a medium for all our history. Marks in stone, inscriptions, frescoes and now
				monuments are all traces of our existence here. They are the marks ancestral civilizations have left
				behind in the spaces we inhabit, and they will be the marks we inevitably leave for the next ones to
				come. A sense of cyclicality and stratification imbues our history in rich juxtapositions of past and
				present—what was kept and what is now to be decided.

				This is a transcription of the Trajan column, built after the Roman emperor Traianus wiped a whole
				population in the Dacian wars, in what was considered a heroic victory for the empire. Even without
				being able to understand its content, still, this inscription seems to radiate a sense of importance, an
				intrinsic power—in the dignity of its Latin or in the capitalization of its letters, lies a feeling of
				monumentality.

			<p class="chapterone" id="caption">
				The column’s narrative is constructed in upward spiralling movie-sequence, so that the illiterate
				population could understand the events being described. I would say this is an early example of state
				propaganda.
			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">
				Monuments have, until now, been reserved for figures of said importance, and events that have shaped our
				society; the grandness of their stone reflects the significancy of what they represent—they are evidence
				of the great feats of our society. A mark for ones who have left a mark in our world. They are guardians
				of history, crusaders of memory, keeping record of what or who should be remembered.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				It could be said that they are the fossils of our recent past, inlaid in those pieces centuries of
				history that withstand time, war and all its paradigm shifts. Though, differently from fossils, the
				marks they have left are not the product of chance, rather a deliberate act of demarcation. These
				inscriptions are the names of the people that were chosen to be seen as our history—but who are the ones
				given the power to choose?

			</p>
			<p class="chapterone">

				It’s baffling how monuments are an easy way of cementing a version of history as the truth. After all,
				differing opinions and dissent will fade with the years passing, but those stones will remain. While our
				memories may faulter and fail, these monuments are infallible—and so suddenly, they become the
				long-lasting evidence of that time—and the one who wields the power to build them laughs last.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				In this way, monuments become an instrument. Consolidating a vision, they preserve something in a
				snapshot of time, and their pedestal grants gravity to what they represent.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				But monuments, I would argue, have become more abstract in the last two centuries. Statues for generals
				or kings have not been built after the world wars, and the records of our history come now in different
				gestures. We no longer look up at these statues, and they go largely unnoticed while we bathe in the sun
				of our public squares.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				To think of monuments only as those sculptures is to focus only on one idea of what a monument is (or
				was), failing to question what are the new forms of monuments we may have built in our modern times. The
				sculptures have been rendered unimportant, and the square has now turned into a complex web of
				intangible areas—be it the internet, artistic discourse, academia, political groups, warzones, etc, etc.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				But what have the sculptures turned into? What has taken the place of the old monuments in our
				public—urban or digital—landscapes? What are our new monuments?


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				In a way, any piece of communication—any mark—that is made public, published, posted has the potential
				to be a monument. They are, to their core, an act more than the object itself, the materialization is
				somewhat irrelevant, but the symbolic gesture of monumentalizing something, that is the crucial element.
				It is the act of canonizing something, giving it the avail of prospective relevancy. They are
				checkpoints of history, deciding as it progresses what is important to stay. The power to write history.

			<div class="conversation_wrapper">
				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– But what are you trying to say?


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– I’m trying to broaden the concept of what a monument is. Like, I consider a book a monument; that
					is
					so clear in my mind, and I’m having difficulty explaining this to people but... it’s just so clear
					for
					me, I can feel it. Maybe they are not largely considered as monuments because they weren’t really
					available until the invention of paperback in the eighteen hundreds. They were locked up in
					monasteries
					for no one to read, but, if you think about it, they have the same function as a monument.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Why are you trying to force the concept of a monument into the concept of a book?


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Because I think the meaning behind a monument is beautiful, and I think it can be transposed to
					other
					things. Something that is made public, shared, that people can find it and tap into a specific piece
					of
					knowledge from days past, centuries past. I think that’s beautiful.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Then you’re speaking of artifacts?


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Yes! And no, they’re similar... but artifacts weren’t made with the idea of having to last
					centuries,
					they just happened to survive time. Monuments are made with the intent of existing for a long time.
					Like, a book is bound, sturdy, and has something to “cover” all the pages because it wants to exist
					for
					long—so you can read it, put it on the shelf, come back to it, give it to your children... pass
					around
					the knowledge stored in it.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– So, a plastic bag is a monument.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– What? No... why would you think that?


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Well, it lasts a long time, and it carries a certain kind of knowledge; if you are an
					anthropologist
					three thousand years from now, you can learn a lot from a plastic bag from 2023.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Yea, but the plastic bag doesn’t have the function of carrying a piece of knowledge, it has the
					function of carrying things. Also, it wasn’t made with the intention of lasting a long time, that’s
					just
					a consequence of using something made from petroleum.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– What if I print the Rosetta stone on a plastic bag?


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Yeah then, sure, if you want it to be a monument so bad...


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– ... But I still don’t get it, the concept of a book is beautiful by itself, why do you need to add
					another meaning to it?


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Because there is a certain way that people relate to monuments, when something is monumental—there
					is
					even a word that derives from it, something that is imposing, grand, respectable, stately... I want
					people to feel that same respect towards other forms of communication.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Maybe your thesis should be a big propaganda for books, then...


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– Yea maybe that’s what it is in the end.


				</p>

				<p class="chapterone" id="conversation">

					– It was never about monuments.


				</p>

			</div>


			<p class="chapterone">

				Within this broader sense of what a monument can be, I see two types: one old and one new.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Old monuments, I believe to be the corrupted ones—an old way of making monuments. Turned into
				commodities, weapons, or means to sell something, they are a way for some kind of power to establish
				itself over a people. They are the statues for generals we don’t wish to immortalize and the propaganda
				for regimes who crave to infect the discourse and seize power.

				Mussolini’s strategy was one of the contamination of an aesthetic with his fascist ideology. He took
				hostage of the styles of the time, like the Italian Art Déco and Neoclassical, to create an aesthetic
				that is not explicitly fascist, but speaks volumes in between the lines.
			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				The new form of monuments I will call parniments. From the Latin “pars” meaning to be a part of
				something, and “mens” which relates to the mind and spirit: they are the individual’s part in the
				building of a collective memory, a collective mind and spirit. A reminder of the collective significance
				of a piece of individual history, made universal. Parniments are born out of a necessity to share
				something that feels relevant, in the hopes of connecting with each other in our many symmetries.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Parniments are more of an invitation to an old monument’s imposition.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				But they both share, in the end, the same nature, with differing messaging or strategies. Monuments are
				all acts of representation, as any work of communication is. They present and represent a specific
				vision of history; old monuments may hide behind their apparent objectivity, when in reality, we all
				know they were written by the victors, as the saying goes... parniments, on the other hand, tend to be
				more forthcoming with the figure of its individual, subjective maker.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Old monuments are the representation of normativity, of what was cemented as the normal. Foucault speaks
				of the “norm” in his literature dissecting the works of discipline (and punishment), saying that
				“normalization consists in trying to get people, movements, and actions to conform to this model.” Old
				monuments are part of a movement to indoctrinate a specific model as the only truth, or simply, the
				norm. They leave little space for different views, setting their ideas in physical and metaphoric stone.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				In contrast to the stones of an old monument, parniments, on the other hand, move more like smoke, more
				malleable like paper; and their manifestations tend to be more ephemeral as well, like an oral story, a
				book or a zine. It says something about the power imbalance in the production of monuments, when the
				ones behind old monuments have the resources to build foul statues of bulls in the centre of New York
				city, and the others can only resort to self-published, self-funded ephemerals—the game is somewhat
				rigged as to whom has the bigger chance of lasting... So, I beg to question: why is Wall Street
				inscribed in gold and the Black Panthers printed in Xerox?

				[Fig. 4] <em>Statue of the Charging Bull, standing on Broadway in the Financial District of
					Manhattan.</em>
			</p>


			<p class="chapterone">

				Parniments, on the other hand, are simply a piece of someone’s memory turned palpable. They don’t take
				their place for granted or stand so presumptuous to assume their importance; rather,
				they are humble—not shy—in their positioning, and attentive to how they could be perceived. They are
				urgent in their conscience because their existence may be of help for others—empowering a group through
				one’s process of empowerment.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Queer zines—especially along the sixties, seventies and eighties—were a great safety net of parniments.
				Collections of poetry, anecdotes, recommendations, reader’s submissions, and written or photographic
				essays
				plastered the poorly printed but oh-so-vibrant pages. They were explosive and intellectual, and a sense
				of urgency paired over each line. Today—undeterred by the flimsiness of their pages—these zines
				thankfully survived the test of time, and what was once the necessity to connect with each other in a
				present’s uncertainty, now has crystalized with time. They are an artifact turned into a monument, and
				now future generations can trace back a whole past of queer life and struggle.

			<h2 class="intro" id="intro_manual">A SMALL MANUAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF MONUMENTS</h2>

			<p class="manual_intro_paragraph">
				Alas! The previous text has presented monuments only in abstraction, but if one had or
				wanted to build a monument, what are the directions to take? All you need is the three components that
				make up a monument, which relate to
				three different points in time of the creative process: </p>


			<div class="manual_container">
				<div class="manual_column">

					<p class="manual_paragraph" id="manual_title">
						<u>Function</u>: <em>The present.</em>
					</p>

					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						The thought that the maker puts into the process while creating it. Monuments have fundamentally
						the
						function of preserving a piece of knowledge and make it public. They must be public, so the
						knowledge is easily accessible to a community—this is what separates a monument from an
						artifact.

					</p>
					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						An artifact is a letter from a long-lost lover, a grandma’s hat or my mother’s keychain, they
						have
						personal significance, but because of their private setting, they miss the opportunity of
						connecting
						to a broader audience—being shrouded in mystery and surrounded by questions around its history.
						The
						knowledge they carry is lost in time because the ones connected to it pass away, and the
						knowledge
						is unfortunately lost, not preserved.
					</p>

					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						The act of publishing is the act of connecting with others. It is transformative for a work to
						be
						open to the eyes of others, in an increasingly dialectic experience of making public. When
						others
						connect with your work, something is moved within them, and then they may feel energised to go
						and
						move something within the work—and if the maker is attentive and open to it, the results can
						prove
						to be quite fruitful.

					</p>

					<p class="chapterone" id="caption">
						[Fig. 5] <em>A medieval manuscript without its cover; it is astonishing how the structure of a

				<div class="manual_column">

					<p class="manual_paragraph" id="manual_title">
						<u>Intention</u>: <em>The bridging between present and future.</em>
					</p>

					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						It is all the pragmatic decisions made in the present that will have an effect later. Somethings
						might be made with the intention to be eternal, some will be of use only in a distant future,
						some may be purposefully erased, others have no problem in being ephemeral—like a flyer is only
						needed up until the day of the party. Somethings may not even be a monument in its inception but
						still become one—unintentional monuments.

					</p>


					<img class="image_visible" id="image_manual" src="assets/images/amber.png">

					<p class="chapterone" id="caption">
						[Fig. 6] <em>Skeleton of a frog preserved in Burmese amber. </em>
					</p>

					<p class="chapterone" id="caption">
						Arbitrary, unintentional monuments can trap a certain zeitgeist and preserve it for the future,
						like a frog trapped in an amber fossil.
					</p>


					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						But fundamentally, a monument has the intention of lasting for quite some time. They must, so
						the knowledge is available for future generations.
					</p>

					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						Thinking of the time component of your work also changes the way to relate to it. It’s a way of
						elevating and respecting it: to know that what you have made is valuable and should withstand
						time. You and your vision should be historicized because it may be relevant to your (future)
						peers.
					</p>
				</div>


				<div class="manual_column">

					<p class="manual_paragraph" id="manual_title">
						<u>People</u>: <em>The future.</em>
					</p>

					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						It relies on the outside audience: the people passing by the square, reading the book—the ones
						contemplating and digesting that piece of culture—they will decide if that piece of
						communication has any relevancy. The monument’s fate, whether it will be cemented (or not),
						lives in the court of public opinion. How to catch their attention? How to turn their heads? How
						to make sure that they will want to preserve your monument?

					</p>
					<p class="manual_paragraph">
						You must be generously confident in yourself, and the story you want to tell. A monument must be
						commemorative of something, a degree of celebration is always welcome. To celebrate the topic,
						the work, the maker, and all the shoulders they may stand on—this abundance influences and
						emanates from the work, inviting people into the party. This exhilaration is the component to
						grant the grandness we typically connect with monuments. Make it big, not necessarily in size,
						but in presence.

			<p class="chapterone">
				Layered echelons of history, all building on top and affirming the previous one. Heroes on the shoulders
				of heroes, but who elected them our saviours in the first place? Who holds the power to inscribe the
				names on our monuments?

			<p class="chapterone">
				Michel Foucault speaks of a new society, one of power relations structured around a biopower: a
				government with the power to control bodies and subjugate life itself. It is an act of dehumanization
				through uniformity and regulation, turning citizens into patients, students, inmates in an increasing
				institutionalization of society. In what he calls the anatomo-biopolitics, a state seeks to control
				different parts of the human body, like birth, death, reproduction and illnesses. Hospitals, schools,
				prisons, asylums are different ways for a government to enact control.
			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">
				As part of a system of biopolitics, the state engages in constituting biological bodies as “objects of
				knowledge,” studying, observing them, and in turn producing new knowledge—new norms—to control them
				with. Eugenic scientists measured skulls of citizens to then stipulate that people of African descent
				had smaller craniums, and therefore decreased mental capacity—an obvious fallacy, but it still served as
				basis for the ideology of the Nazi regime and helped legitimize their actions against the ones that
				didn’t belong to the Aryan race. As Foucault states: “power and knowledge directly imply one another,” <span id="1" class="figurelink">[Footnote 1]</span><img id="fig1" class="figure"

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">
				The field of study interested in knowledge is denominated Epistemology—from the Greek “epistḗmē” meaning
				knowledge and “logía” meaning the study of something. Epistemological scholars see knowledge as a
				commodity that can be hierarchized and used as an instrument in the maintenance of power, trying to
				dissect what are the infrastructures or people involved in the production and upkeep of knowledge, and
				how do they make use of it.




			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Portuguese sociologist, in turn coins the term Epistemicide. The swapping of
				the suffix “logy” to “cide” (referring to the act of killing) changes its meaning, to that of the murder
				of an entire body of knowledge, or the killing through knowledge. Epistemicide becomes even more
				significant through the lens of Foucault’s theory of biopower, where a State, in disregarding a group’s
				contribution to the cultural heritage, denies their place in cultural production and, ultimately, life
				in society.


			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				In The Will to Knowledge, Foucault describes a shift after the Middle Ages from a politics of kings to a
				politics of society. It was a shift from individual to collective, from the punishment of an individual
				for its crimes, to now the control of a whole group of people to assure safety in society. He delineates
				that it is precisely in this shift that the notion of state racism is born, explaining the dangerous
				idea that legitimizes the criminalization of bodies: “the more abnormal individuals are eliminated, the
				fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I—as species rather than
				individual—can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be.” <span id="1" class="figurelink">[Footnote 2]</span><img id="fig1" class="figure"

				David Wojnarowicz used self-portraiture as a way to monumentalize himself, allowing the viewer into his

			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph_first">

				To the bleak situation detailed in part one, I propose a plan of mimicking. A plan of sneaky
				disobedience and stealthy rebellion, a tactic to infiltrate the channels of history—like wedding
				crashers at a party they weren’t invited to. To take from them what we need to build it all ourselves,
				for I am greedy, and I want to see my name and that of my peers inscribed on the pillars of history.

			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph">

				To the concept of mimicking, Plato brings the idea of mimesis. He speaks of the example of theatre—where
				life is interpreted and represented—saying that art imitates nature. Mimesis is the act of
				re-presenting, as in presenting something twofold: an object (or idea) is first presented by coming into
				this world, to then be represented by us humans. It is inherently the act of taking something, and by
				passing through your own self, make it yours and anew: retelling it in your own vision.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph">

				Monuments are, in the end, works of mimesis—there are few differences between the ones they built and
				our monuments—they are all works of representation, looking at history and proposing one interpretation
				of it. They offer just one individual interpretation, for an absolute truth is unreachable—to get closer
				to it we must have an abundance of them. We must be so bold to insert ourselves in the discourse.


			</p>


			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph">
				But to make our own monuments—our parniments—we could borrow a tad of the forcefulness of the old
				ones. <span id="1" class="figurelink">[Fig. 12]</span><img id="fig1" class="figure"
					src="assets/images/wiley.png" />

				Like Foucault says, knowledge implies power, and vice-versa. Thus the plan is to study and observe, to
				then
				produce new knowledge; to borrow confidence from established historical works, and in turn squeeze our
				production amongst them.

				<p class="chapterone" id="caption_chaptertwo">
					A clear example of mimicking, Wiley explicitly inserts his subjects into equestrian portraits from
					antiquity, rewriting history in an act of self-imposed respect. He also utilizes the same title of
					the painting he is mimicking, elevating his black subjects to the heights of princes and kings.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph">

				But “who is us?” you might ask, and to that I say it is me and you, reader. It will be a collective
				effort
				to decentralize the construction of monuments; all those who are not in positions of power should take
				part:
				independent artists, designers, collectives. And who is them? They are intuitively those that rest in
				the
				privilege of controlling the cultural production; sometimes it is beneficial to explicit who is the
				enemy, not to live in resentment of them, but to know, in their opposition, who are our allies, who are
				the
				ones we
				should historicize?

			</p>


			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph">


				I really enjoy the idea of historicizing the self: to treat one as historical, history-worthy; the word
				“treat” here almost implying it should not really have a place in history, but we make it so. <span
					id="1" class="figurelink">[Fig. 13]</span><img id="fig1" class="figure"
					src="assets/images/warhol.png" /> Perhaps
				fuelled by the fear of oblivion after our deaths, or frightened by the idea that some groups of people
				are more easily forgotten than others, we live through the monuments we leave behind—may they endure
				time’s
				unforgiving hand...

			<p class="chapterone" id="chaptertwo_paragraph">

				And how to historicize oneself? I believe the answer lies in aesthetics, which is, after all, a
				language, an instrument. <span id="1" class="figurelink">[Fig. 14]</span><img id="fig1" class="figure"
					src="assets/images/cindy.jpeg" /> A system of communication comprised of (visual) signifiers,
				symbols and vocabulary, that can be combined to convey a message largely understood by people. These are
				resources
				that can be moulded and bent to our will, we may borrow the vocabulary from someone else, but we make
				the words ours.

				By using a vernacular that is—for better or worse—for all to understand, you provide entry points to
				your work. All can access the external strata of your piece, because it may speak of something they
				already know; <span id="1" class="figurelink">[Fig. 15]</span><img id="fig1" class="figure"
					src="assets/images/bible.png" /> and then, like a fish fooled by bait, you can yank them out of the
				water and show them a
				whole new world. Beauty, for example, is a great way of luring people in; by making something so
				visually appealing that people must look at it, and then be involuntarily faced with a content they
				wouldn’t normally be interested in.

					Broomberg and Chanarin publish an illustrated version of the Bible, with a message: God reveals

				Think of the revival of medieval aesthetics in the last years, where designers, by studying the

					class="figure" src="assets/images/visio.png" /> folklore and heraldic shields, see an opportunity of
				transporting
				themselves back to the Middle Ages. A way of retelling history, using the visual language of an era to
				give another vision of the events that transpired then; using the aesthetic of a time where witches were
				burned to now represent the witch as a feminist figure, for example. A
				way of fabricating a new
				document, stealing the visuals of that time, learning from it, mutating and recontextualizing it.

				Mimesis, then, as a form of reclaiming power. Re-appropriating as a way of forcefully inserting yourself

				what is not ours and recite it in a new light, into something that makes sense for us. To take a queer
				poem and typeset it in Garamond 12pt in a page of golden ratio... but then make it huge, and print it on

				In this project, I decided to look at artifacts and examine what in my life could last to become an

			<p class="title" id="sub">A MORE PERSONAL CONCLUSION</p>

			<p class="chapterone" id="text_conclusion">
				When faced with our modern world, I feel as though the scales are all wrong: I find myself so small and
				all
				else is so catastrophic, too apocalyptic, engulfing and overwhelming. In feeling this powerlessness, the
				temptation to give everything up to cynicism creeps around my mind, but I refuse to accept that as my
				future, one of apathy and disconnection; even if it may prove to be naïve, I feel like taking matters
				into my own hands.
			</p>


			<p class="chapterone" id="text_conclusion">

				I believe in seeing ourselves as part of history, and not just passive bystanders; to
				understand ourselves as active collaborators in the never-ending cycles of knowledge in this world. To
				fight against
				the “annihilation of intellectual confidence,” as Sueli Carneiro says, and monumentalize my life.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone" id="text_conclusion">

				When I speak of history, I understand my words may gush tones of grandeur, but, in a way, I
				believe history is simply what we have decided to remember, which means we can choose to make our own
				history. To tilt the scales, and create our own small villages, societies full of their own records of
				past and present; for history lives inside us, it flows through and within us.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone" id="text_conclusion">

				Then, we shall jump in the rivers of history; live in the current of our times and watch our waves
				reverberate and be magnified by the waves of others. Ultimately an exercise in self-worth, to fabricate
				it—if necessary—and see ourselves as powerful images erected shoulder-to-shoulder in a procession
				stretching all the way to those first cave paintings. For I want my name and those of my peers carved in
				the pillars of history—whichever one it may be.
