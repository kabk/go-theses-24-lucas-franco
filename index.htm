			<p class="chapterone">

				The world began with fossils, though they were not fossils at the time. Now we study them as remnants of
				a distant history, but once they were living breathing organisms. Now incapsulated in rock, how much
				truth can we distil from stone?

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				Stone has served humans as a medium for all our history. Marks in stone, inscriptions, frescoes and now
				monuments are all traces of our existence here. They are the marks ancestral civilizations have left
				behind in the spaces we inhabit, and they will be the marks we inevitably leave for the next ones to
				come. A sense of cyclicality and stratification imbues our history in rich juxtapositions of past and
				present—what was kept and what is now to be decided.

			<p class="chapterone">
				All to be had, in the end, are fossils.

				This is a transcription of the Trajan column, built after the Roman emperor Traianus wiped a whole
				population in the Dacian wars, in what was considered a heroic victory for the empire. Even without
				being able to understand its content, still, this inscription seems to radiate a sense of importance, an
				intrinsic power—in the dignity of its Latin or in the capitalization of its letters, lies a feeling of
				monumentality.

				[Figure 2] <em>Detail of the Trajan column.</em>
			</p>

			<p class="chapterone" id="caption">
				The column’s narrative is constructed in upward spiralling movie-sequence, so that the illiterate
				population could understand the events being described. I would say this is an early example of state
				propaganda.
			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">
				Monuments have, until now, been reserved for figures of said importance, and events that have shaped our
				society; the grandness of their stone reflects the significancy of what they represent—they are evidence
				of the great feats of our society. A mark for ones who have left a mark in our world. They are guardians
				of history, crusaders of memory, keeping record of what or who should be remembered.

			</p>

			<p class="chapterone">

				It could be said that they are the fossils of our recent past, inlaid in those pieces centuries of
				history that withstand time, war and all its paradigm shifts. Though, differently from fossils, the
				marks they have left are not the product of chance, rather a deliberate act of demarcation. These
				inscriptions are the names of the people that were chosen to be seen as our history—but who are the ones
				given the power to choose?

			</p>
			<p class="chapterone">

				It’s baffling how monuments are an easy way of cementing a version of history as the truth. After all,
				differing opinions and dissent will fade with the years passing, but those stones will remain. While our
				memories may faulter and fail, these monuments are infallible—and so suddenly, they become the
				long-lasting evidence of that time—and the one who wields the power to build them laughs last.
